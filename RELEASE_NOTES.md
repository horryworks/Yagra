# Release Notes

## v0.1.3

**Distributed poller pools** — Yagra can now spread polling across pollers placed close to the
monitored devices. Each node carries a **pool** attribute (a site or region); the central server
tracks poller liveness, assigns each pool's nodes across its live pollers with consistent hashing,
and pushes each poller its working set over the bus. A remote poller dials out to the central NATS
bus (NAT/firewall-friendly), so branch-site segments can be monitored without inbound access. This
release also brings the passive event monitoring, topology map, and per-node event features.

### New Features
- **Distributed poller pools (location-affinity assignment + failover)** — deploy pollers at remote
  sites and assign nodes to them by a **pool** attribute (defaults to one pool, `default`). The
  central coordinator watches poller heartbeats, distributes each pool's work across its live
  pollers using a consistent-hash ring (so adding or losing a poller reshuffles the minimum), and
  fails a departed poller's nodes over to the survivors in the same pool automatically. Pollers
  receive their assignment as a working-set snapshot and then incremental deltas, and reconnect with
  a full resync — no polling gaps across restarts. A new **Settings ▸ Pollers** page lists every
  poller with its pool, status, version, working-set size, and last heartbeat, warns when a pool has
  nodes but no live poller, and includes a **Register poller** dialog that generates the remote
  poller's configuration. A pool with no live poller falls back to the existing central polling, so
  upgrades are seamless. Ships with a `docker-compose.poller.yml` for remote sites and a NATS
  TLS + authentication configuration for exposing the bus across trust boundaries.
- **Passive event monitoring (syslog / SNMP traps / webhooks)** — besides active polling, Yagra now
  receives syslog (RFC 5424/3164) and SNMP v1/v2c traps and accepts inbound webhooks, matches them
  against operator-defined rules (substring / regex) to raise alerts, and can forward the
  fire/resolve lifecycle to PagerDuty (Events API v2) and Jira Service Management (Alerts API).
- **Topology Network map** — a new visualization of the dependency graph, so you can see how nodes
  relate and how a parent outage cascades to its children.
- **Per-node event view** — the node-detail page gains an **Events** tab, and the Events page can be
  filtered to a single node (with a node picker and a `?node_id=` deep link). The event log fetching,
  paging, and columns are shared between the two views.
- **Free-text search on Alerts ▸ Events** — filter the event log by an arbitrary search string.

## v0.1.2

Cisco Meraki monitoring over the **read-only** Dashboard API. Meraki devices appear as ordinary
nodes in the same HostTree as your SNMP/ICMP hosts, but are collected per **organization** (one
paged, org-wide API call covers many devices) so a large Meraki estate never trips the org's API
rate limit — and the integration can only ever *read* from Meraki.

### New Features
- **Cisco Meraki (Dashboard API) monitoring** — add a Meraki organization under **Settings ▸
  Integrations ▸ Cisco Meraki** with a read-only API key (one key can onboard several organizations
  at once). An import wizard enumerates the org's networks and devices and lets you choose which to
  monitor; imported devices become normal nodes, auto-placed under an **Organization → Network**
  group tree, and carry a **Meraki** badge in the inventory tree. Collected metrics — device
  availability, WAN uplink loss / latency / status, client count, and traffic usage — surface on a
  new Cisco Meraki card on the node-detail page. Per-organization controls let you pause/resume
  collection, tune per-tier polling cadence and the request-rate budget, and edit which networks are
  in scope.

### Security
- **Read-only by design, with layered safeguards** — the integration issues HTTP **GET only** to
  Meraki (no configuration is ever written), and every request is restricted to allow-listed Meraki
  API hosts so the API key cannot be sent elsewhere. The key is **encrypted at rest** (never
  returned by the API or written to logs), polling is paced well under the per-organization API cap
  to leave headroom for your own tooling, and a global **Meraki polling kill switch** on the
  Integrations page can halt all Meraki collection instantly.

## v0.1.1

A small follow-up to the first release: a dedicated About page, a self-health page split out of
Pollers, and a genuinely rootless WebUI container.

### New Features
- **Settings ▸ About** — a new page that gathers product identity and running versions in one place:
  the live Core / API version (via a new public `GET /api/v1/version` endpoint), the WebUI build
  version, the repository link, and the license. Showing both versions side by side makes a
  core/web skew during a rolling upgrade obvious at a glance.

### Improvements
- **System Health is now its own page** — Yagra's self-health (poll-loop counters, backing-service
  reachability, data coverage) moved out of Settings ▸ Pollers into a dedicated Settings ▸ System
  Health page. The Pollers entry is reserved as a placeholder for future distributed-poller
  configuration.

### Security
- **The WebUI container now runs fully rootless** — the web image is built on `nginx-unprivileged`
  and serves as a non-root user, so it listens on container port **8080** instead of 80. The
  bundled Docker Compose files already map this, so standard deployments are unaffected (the WebUI
  stays on host port 3000 by default); update any custom reverse proxy or orchestration that
  targeted the web container's port 80.

## v0.1.0

First release of Yagra — a network monitoring system (NMS) that watches network devices and
servers via ICMP / SNMP / API calls, built from the start for tens of thousands of nodes and
distributed polling. Ships as Docker containers with a Rust backend and a React WebUI.

### New Features
- **Monitoring & polling** — ICMP liveness, SNMP v2c and v3 (USM auth/priv) scalar and table
  collection (including multi-index tables), and URL / HTTP(S) endpoint monitoring with TLS
  certificate-expiry tracking. Raw counters are stored and rates derived at query time (wrap/reset
  safe). Configurable global and per-Device-Profile poll intervals, with interval jitter and
  per-device rate limiting / backpressure.
- **Discovery & classification** — network discovery over IP ranges and lists with a
  stored-credential picker; automatic device classification by sysObjectID / sysDescr that applies
  the matching Device Profile; a Credential Finder that tries stored credentials by reference
  (rate-limited per device, attempted values never logged).
- **Device profiles & collection** — a role × network-OS profile taxonomy with editable Collection
  Templates, Classification Rules, and a curated MIB/OID catalog, all searchable. Built-in coverage
  for common vendors (Cisco, Huawei — including USG firewall sessions and RAM, Meraki MX/MS, A10)
  plus standard host and interface MIBs.
- **Alerting** — an explicit state machine with dwell-time hysteresis, flapping detection,
  dependency suppression with root-cause roll-up (parent down ⇒ children suppressed), maintenance
  windows, mutes, and dedup / grouping. Append-only alert history shows human-readable node/check
  names and a "What" (metric + condition) column, with read-only acknowledgement reflected from
  external tools such as PagerDuty / Jira Service Management (ADR-015). Email and webhook
  notification channels with retry.
- **Dashboards & visualization** — an admin-customizable Shared Dashboard and a per-user,
  multi-board My Dashboard built from a widget library: fleet health timeline, Top-N CPU / memory /
  interfaces, traffic deltas, aggregate throughput, utilization heatmap, geo map, dependency /
  root-cause topology, data-coverage gauge, alert-history aggregations, and poller / collection
  health. A node tree with split-view node detail, per-interface sparklines, and time-series charts
  with a shared range control (1h–7d + custom) and configured-bandwidth reference lines.
- **Reports** — customizable report sections rendered to HTML / CSV / PDF, with saved definitions
  and scheduled runs (Dashboard ▸ Reports).
- **Troubleshooting** — an analysis-tools catalog running asynchronous analysis jobs over
  VictoriaMetrics (e.g. anomaly detection), scoped to a single node or a group (recursively).
- **Administration** — role-based access control (viewer / operator / admin) with group-scoped
  visibility, user management, an immutable audit log of every configuration change and login, and
  Yagra self-health monitoring (Settings ▸ Pollers and `GET /api/v1/system-health`).
- **WebUI** — a React + TypeScript single-page app over one typed REST client, with live updates
  via SSE (bearer-authenticated), light / dark theming, and virtualized, server-paged lists built
  for tens of thousands of nodes.
- **Deployment** — a single-node Docker Compose stack (Yagra-core, Yagra-poller, Yagra-web,
  PostgreSQL, Redis, NATS, VictoriaMetrics) with non-root images and `CAP_NET_RAW` granted only to
  the poller for raw-socket ICMP. Expand-contract database migrations keep upgrades data-preserving.

### Security
- Monitoring credentials (SNMP communities, SNMPv3 USM credentials, API tokens) are encrypted at
  rest with envelope encryption — AES-256-GCM data keys wrapped by a key-encryption key loaded from
  a mounted secret file. Secrets are never logged, returned in API responses, or used as metric /
  trace labels.
- Every state-changing API endpoint enforces authentication and RBAC and is recorded in the audit
  log.
- Outbound HTTP from URL monitors and notification webhooks is guarded against SSRF: loopback,
  link-local, and cloud-metadata targets are refused — including IPv4-mapped IPv6 forms and across
  HTTP redirects — while legitimate private / internal ranges stay monitorable.
- TLS certificate verification is on by default for URL monitors; disabling it is an explicit,
  per-monitor opt-in.
